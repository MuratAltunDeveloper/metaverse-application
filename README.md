In this project, I developed a platform called META-LAND TRADE GAME. Using Java programming language and PostgreSQL database system, I designed a game that simulates commercial transactions such as buying, selling and renting land and markets in a virtual environment. Two different user roles, players and administrators, were created and their rights and access to the system were limited by certain rules. In addition, I organized all transaction data with database design and created the user interface with the “Swing” library. This project is a study that teaches object-oriented programming and SQL logic in depth.
